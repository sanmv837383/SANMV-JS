// left rotate array by n number of places
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] there are 7 positions in the array if n = 7 then after the rotation the element comes 
back to the same position . Hence 7+1 = next position from the existing position
7+2 = after the next position from the current position. silmilarly the program works
therefore d = d % n
