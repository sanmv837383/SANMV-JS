protocol - some rules which are made by the people like video conference , important file transferring
everything has different requirement and based on that requirement different protocols are defined - tcp ip udp
internet society creates the rules for how the things should be
rfc editor - request for comments can suggest what to do in internet society

Client server architecture
client --> request --> server
server --> response --> client

Protocols
TCP - transpecian control protocol
ensure that data will reach its destination and not get corrupted
UDP - user datagram protocol
not all data is reached properly and that's fine by us
HTTP- hypertext transfer protocol used by world wide web
the format of the database is being forwarded using this

How data is transfered
data is sent in packets
these servers and computers and identified by their IP address
X.X.X.X every single X here can have the numbers from 0 -m 255

to check the ip address of my internet provider
$ curl if config.me -s
internet service provider - ISP - airtel
ISP --> modem/router - it has global IP address 
hence devices connecting to this ISP will ahve same IP address
the different ip address would be given to the different devices connected they are known as local IP ddress
DHCP - dynamic host configuration protocol   // this will assign the different ip address to different device
for google only the global ip address is visible not local ip address

port numbers
ip address where is computer located
port number which application are you using 
port is 16 bit number - each cell contain 2 numbers 0/1 - 2^16 == 65000 - total port numbers possible
