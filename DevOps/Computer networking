protocol - some rules which are made by the people like video conference , important file transferring
everything has different requirement and based on that requirement different protocols are defined - tcp ip udp
internet society creates the rules for how the things should be
rfc editor - request for comments can suggest what to do in internet society

Client server architecture
client --> request --> server
server --> response --> client

Protocols
TCP - transpecian control protocol
ensure that data will reach its destination and not get corrupted
UDP - user datagram protocol
not all data is reached properly and that's fine by us
HTTP- hypertext transfer protocol used by world wide web
the format of the database is being forwarded using this

How data is transfered
data is sent in packets
these servers and computers and identified by their IP address
X.X.X.X every single X here can have the numbers from 0 -m 255

to check the ip address of my internet provider
$ curl if config.me -s
internet service provider - ISP - airtel
ISP --> modem/router - it has global IP address 
hence devices connecting to this ISP will ahve same IP address
the different ip address would be given to the different devices connected they are known as local IP ddress
DHCP - dynamic host configuration protocol   // this will assign the different ip address to different device
for google only the global ip address is visible not local ip address

port numbers
ip address where is computer located
port number which application are you using 
port is 16 bit number - each cell contain 2 numbers 0/1 - 2^16 == 65000 - total port numbers possible
HTTP - 80
MONGODB - 27017
SQL - 1433
0 - 1023 - reserved ports 
1024 - 49152 - registered for applications like mongodb mysql etc
remaining ports can be used

1Mbps - mega bits per second - 1000000 bits/s
1 gbps = 10^9 bits/s
1kbps = 1000 bits/s

submarine cable.com - 28000 km
physically : optical fibre cables, coaxial cables
wireless: bluetooth, wifi, 3g 4g 5g

LAN: connected by ethernet cable, wifi, small house/ office
MAN: metroploian area network across city
WAN: wide area network across country
optical fibre cables
SONET - synchronous optical networking
Frame relay local area network is connected to wider area network

TOPOLOGY
BUS topology
RING topology
STAR topology
TREE topology (combination of bus and start)
MESH topology - every computer is connected to every other computer

Structure of network
Application layer 
OSI model - open system interconnection model 
7 layers
Applicaton layer - browser and messaging layer, network application like skype etc
Presentation layer - data from the application layer , these data or the character 
will be converted to machine understandable binary format. From ASCII to EBC EIC this is called translation
Encoding and encryption happens here SSL-secure software layer, abstraction, data is compressed 
Session layer - helps in setting up and managing the connections and enables the sending and receiving the data followed by the termination of the connected session
authentication username and password,authorisation , it just establishes the session
Transport layer - udp and tcp - data received from the session layer is divided into the small segments called the segmentation
every segment will contain the source and destination sequence number, flow control(transport layer control amount of data being sent) error control (checksum) and the port number
Network layer - router - logical addressing(ip addressing done here) it assigns the senders and receivers ip address in every segment and it forms an 
IP packet so that every data packet is reaching to the correct destination, load balancing
Data link layer - allows you to directly communiate with the host, logical addressing - network layer about ip address senders and receivers ip address
Physical addressing - mac adresses(12 digit alpha numeric number of the network interface of you computer computer bluetooth and wifi have different mac address) are sent to 
the sender and receiver to form a frame(data unit of the data link layer) and transport this frame. 
It also controls how the data is placed and received from the media using media access control
techique used to control the error detection
Physical layer - hardware section it transmits the electrical segments, radio signal, in receivers segment- physical layer receives the signal converts into bits 
and pass it into the datalink layer as a frame and moves in higher hierarchy

Another model
TCP IP MODEL
5 layers
Application layer : users interact, lies on the device, protocols client server architecture
server - 
data center- collection of huge number of computers static ip addresses, good internet connection and high 
Transport : 
network
data link
physical layer
