protocol - some rules which are made by the people like video conference , important file transferring
everything has different requirement and based on that requirement different protocols are defined - tcp ip udp
internet society creates the rules for how the things should be
rfc editor - request for comments can suggest what to do in internet society
Client server architecture
client --> request --> server
server --> response --> client
Protocols
TCP - transpecian control protocol
ensure that data will reach its destination and not get corrupted
UDP - user datagram protocol
not all data is reached properly and that's fine by us
HTTP- hypertext transfer protocol used by world wide web
the format of the database is being forwarded using this
How data is transfered
data is sent in packets
these servers and computers and identified by their IP address
X.X.X.X every single X here can have the numbers from 0 -m 255
to check the ip address of my internet provider
$ curl if config.me -s
internet service provider - ISP - airtel
ISP --> modem/router - it has global IP address 
hence devices connecting to this ISP will ahve same IP address
the different ip address would be given to the different devices connected they are known as local IP ddress
DHCP - dynamic host configuration protocol   // this will assign the different ip address to different device
for google only the global ip address is visible not local ip address
port numbers
ip address where is computer located
port number which application are you using 
port is 16 bit number - each cell na contain 2 nubers 0/1 - 2^16 == 65000 - total port numbers possible

peer to peer 
scale it largely

Protocols
TCP/IP : HTTP, DHCP, FTP, SMTP, POP3 and IMAC, SSH,VNC, Telnet(port 23)
UDP : stateless connection
Applications
thread: set up a page to send message
sockets: the interface between the process and the internet
ports: which application we are working with
ephemeral ports
HTTP uses TCP
stateless
http is application layer
tcp is transport layer
HTTP method
GET method
PUT method
POST
DELETE
Status codes
1XX - informational 
2XX - success
3XX - Redirectory
4XX - client error
5XX - server error

When we have to connect with the two or more devices then we have to connect using a switch then we have to bbuild a switch 
between them to connect. To connect them to a switch we need an interface (physical or virtual depending on the host) 
To see the intefaces of the host we use ip link command here we use the interface name eth0 to connect to the switch
switch IP address is : 192.168.1.0 then we assign the devices with same usingip addr add 192.168.1.10/24dev eth0
hence now the computers can talk using these switch
now this is a system created. similar to this there are many systems how does communication between the system happens
Now we need a router to connect two networks it is another server with many network ports , since it gets connected to two different network it gets assigned with two different ip address of both the networks. 
Gateway - to see the existing routing run rout command
add the gateway so that two system can talk using ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
now the route is added in B do this in C too
There is a default gateway which would help in accessing all the request outside of the system - default router - 0.0.0.0 
If we have the multiple network one for the internet and another for the inter connection then we will need to have separate entries
a is connected to b and b is connected to c how does a connect to c
by default in linux the packets received are not forwarded from one system to another
consider eth0 is private network and eth1 is public network then they both cannot forward the information hence if both the system is in eth0 then we can share the files
this is governed by the setting cat/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
by default the value in this setting is 0 which means not allowed but if the values are set to 1 then the ping goes through and we can see if it is allowed. we cannot change this simply to modify we have to use /etc/sysctl.conf
DNS
cat >> /etc/hosts         --> assigning db name to the ip address  --  this is called name resolution
192.168.1.11    db
to resolve a name and match to the ip address we point it out to the dns server 
cat /etc/resolv.conf   --> is where you store the servers and if updation needed then it is done here
.com(commercial or general purpose) . is the root -
.net(network)
.edu(educational)
.org(non profit organisation)
.io 
nslookup
dig
