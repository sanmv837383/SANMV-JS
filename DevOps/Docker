whenever you are creating a application you have to place it in the server for that you had to buy a server in ancient times
you can only place one application in one server
VMWare - created virtual machines and solved this problem
Here we can place multiple application in one server
virtual machine requires there own OS hence it was still not solving the problem
not fast
storage cpu allocation ram allocation
issues with having various dependencies
Virtual machines- this creates different operating system for the application to work
Containers this doesnt create different OS but this works on the virtual machine
Windows : Docker desktop wsl windows system for linux
Runtime --> engine --> Orchestration
Runtime is used to stop the container
There are two types of runtime
- runc (low level runtime)
works with the operating system and starts and stops the container
- container d 
role is to managing runc , it helps in managing containers , how to get data into the container network from internet
Engine
Docker daemon
server daemon --> REST API --> docker CLI
in----------------------------> out
api - create the docker delete the docker these commands can be given using REST api
Orchestration - it allows us to manage the container
dish- application
docker image or container image - it is just a file that contains the instruction
container is the running instance of an image
docker file - reciepe
docker file --> image --> container
template    -->  class --> object
or list of instructions
Open container initiative OCI
docker is the tool which has container in it running on the operating system but its isolated it doesnt knows what is going outside the container
container is the isolated environment in which we can run the application
docker files also containes th os files which hels in running the program
